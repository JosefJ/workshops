Deploying to IPFS
=================

To deploy a dapp to IPFS, all you need to do is run a local IPFS node
and then run ``embark upload ipfs``. If you want to deploy to the livenet then
after configuring you account on ``config/blockchain.json`` on the
``livenet`` environment then you can deploy to that chain by
specifying the environment ``embark ipfs livenet``.
